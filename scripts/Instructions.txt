	To use this Android images kitchen is very easy. First, place your image
files in [input] folder.

Start the kitchen by double click on { carliv.bat } file and follow the informations on the screen - it's easy. All menu letters are case Insensitive and you can type how you want [B or b, etc.], and the numbers... are just numbers :). 

If your phone is MTK powered the kitchen will handle these images automatically. Use same commands as for the regular images and everything else will be done under the hood.

After you finished your modding job, to repack the image do the same, but this time select the repack menu items. NOTE: If you have unpacked more than one image, to repack select that image again from boot or recovery list section, and the script will know to find corresponding folder for repacking (if you have deleted that folder it will display an error on process). To go to image list selection menu, just type [I] - Go Back from unpack/repack scripts menu, then select the image you worked on and want to repack it back. 

The new image will have original name with a time stamp appended to it and will be saved in [output] folder.

ATTENTION! This Image Kitchen is built to work on any path, but to avoid any possible breackage, please don't use folders or images with spaces or special characters in name; use only letters [a-Z], numbers [0-9] and usual signs [- or _], and stay away from [!.,@~`%$#*&(){}[]<>\/....] or other like these.

To simplify the functionality, and to avoid the restriction to specific Drive letter placement, the jobs with called scripts are executed from root of the kitchen (the scripts and images will be temporary copied on root, executed and then deleted). If you prefer the old variant with drag and drop scripts, use version 0.5 from my thread, which is the same as this one, except for the "Terminal GUI" feature.
	
My tool doesn't have restrictions on placement. For me it worked in last partition, in sub-subfolder, without problems.

Please respect my work and if you use it don't forget to hit the THANKS button in my thread or to make a donation to buy me a coffee. And if you take it and share it on other sites, or integrate it in other tools, give proper credits for my work.
	
I built from source every working module, and the archiving part (gzip, xz, bzip2 + cygwin dependencies are from the latest cygwin release).
